# Seer's Chat

A simple chat mod that makes it easy to format standard means of global in-game communication 
(regular chat and emotes via `/me` currently), but also supports sending these messages, along with
other game messages (deaths, advancements, etc.) to other servers with the mod installed via Redis.
