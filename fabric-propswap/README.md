# Seer's PropSwap

This mod allows you to use a type of tool to modify a limited set of the properties of a block in a
way that's similar to using the debug stick.

Currently implemented:

* **Walls** [pickaxe]: Right click to remove all joining elements on the wall you clicked on. Or 
sneak and right click to remove the joining section in the cardinal direction you're looking. You 
can also right-click again while sneaking to toggle through different joining modes. 

* **Fences** [axe]: Right click to remove all joining elements on the wall you clicked on. Or
  sneak and right click to remove the joining section in the cardinal direction you're looking.

* **Glass Panes** [pickaxe]: Right click to remove all joining elements on the wall you clicked on. Or
  sneak and right click to remove the joining section in the cardinal direction you're looking.

In the future:

* **Stairs** [tbd]: Right click to cycle through different stair shapes. You must place the stair in
a way that makes it possible for the shape to exist (i.e. this does not work like Axiom).
